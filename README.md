# MazeBattles.com

MazeBattles.com is a site built with NodeJS and SocketIO where users race one-on-one against their friends to solve generated mazes as quickly as possible. Contributions are GREATLY WELCOMED. Issues that I currently face:
- Make the generation of mazes faster.
- Implement and algorithm that creates more complicated mazes.
- Don't make people watch the generation of the maze (instead, implement a progress bar).
- Allow users to hold down a directional key to move multiple steps in the same direction.
- UI improvements are greatly welcomed.
